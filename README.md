## My Process

### Built with

- ReactJs (Component Based, State Management, React Hooks)
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- JSON Server

### What I Learned

Its a good practice because i started it down with useState and props drilling at first but i change it to useContext and it really make the process much more simpler because having global state is really helpful

### Continued Development

Will try to connect this to firebase as a "mock" backend

updates

I use mock backend with json server
`https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server`

and install it to localhost 5000, thats some alternative from firebase. I think i like this more than firebase.
